# C++ Learning-Journey

In this repository I want to show my progression and projects learning the low-level programming language C++.

## Purpose

The purpose of me learning C++, is to achieve a greater and deeper understanding of computers and how they work under the Hood. Later on I'm also planning to start getting into Competitive programming with enough knowledge and practice. Studying **Data structures** and **Algorithms** seems essential to me. Competitive programming is a huge section of programming with a lot of tasks and logic, but with enough practice everyone should be able to master these.

## Current Learning Plan
My current plan is now mastering the pure fundamentals of the C++ programming language, to gain active knowledge in its obscure syntax. For my learning progress i'll probably start with [@brocodez](https://youtube.com/@brocodez) **6 Hour** introduction course to **C++ programming** teaching the neccessary information to begin with. After completing the course and understanding the fundamentals such as `for loops`, `conditionals`, `functions` and `Object Oriented Programming`. Then is the point of learning the real cool stuff, with librarieres such as **SDL3** and **OpenGL** and getting a good knowledge of **Network Programming** Learning critical and complex **math** and **physics**, formulas and functions to build *simulations*.

## My Current Progression
It is currently the 16.12.2025 where i'm writing this, and I have learned the basic fundamentals.
C++ is in my opinion already a really awesome programming language, it thaught me more than I might have expected. Now setting everything up was a pain but definitely **worth** it. I highly recommend everyone to take a glance at this programming language no matter if you're a basic web developer or maybe just someone who does programming as a hobby.
Now what have I already pretty much learned?
I learned how to include headers with a `include guard`, and how **header files** are structured with normal *.cpp* files, I managed to get a grasp of the basic fundamentals such as `condtitionals`, `loops`, `functions`, `classes`, but something that I still have to practice a lot is working with string manipulation such as reversing a string. The things where I need much more practice are following: **structs**, **Classes**, **Vectors**.
